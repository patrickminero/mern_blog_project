            <p>Hi! My name is Patrick. This blog is about my experience from my year long travels with my wife around 4 continents and life as an immigrant in various countries. Like most other travel bloggers, I was at a point in my life where my daily routine had taken over. I was working 5 days a week and barely making ends meet. Finally, I decided it was enough and I needed a change.
            <br/><br/>
            I started reading blogs, books and watching travel channels on YouTube trying to get ideas on how I could change my life. I wanted to go back to school but the only way that could happen was through student loans as the jobs I was skilled for were minimum wage jobs. After a couple of months of research, I decided to take a second job to save money and in a year, leave the United States for good to travel the world. It was hard working 14 hours, 5 days a week but the hope of one day leaving my routine behind kept me going.
            <br/><br/>
            I would often think about where I would travel to first. Europe was my first choice but when you travel with a passport from a country with a bad reputation, international travel is a bit different. I am a Salvadoran Native and I moved to California back in 2008 escaping the increasing violence against young males by the street gangs. The thought of going back to El Salvador after 10 years was scary but I decided to travel there first to see my family and friends and of course to eat pupusas. And this was the beginning of my trip! Starting from my native country, my wife and I embarked in our journey through 20 countries. We met amazing people while travelling and learned a lot from volunteering in family farms. We were so inspired that once our travels ended, we decided to settle down in a totally new place, Barcelona. The journey was not easy but it opened my eyes to new possibilities and ways of living. I am excited to share my experience and I hope it can inspire others to follow their dreams.</p>
