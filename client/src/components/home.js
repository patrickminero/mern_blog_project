                <p>Hi! My name is Patrick. This blog it’s going to be about my experiences from my year long travels around 4 continents and also about my experience about living in 4 different countries. And just like most of the other travel bloggers I was at a point in my life when my daily routine had taken over, working 5 days a week and barely making ends meet, I decided it was enough. 
                <br/><br/>
                I started reading blogs, books, watched YouTube trying to get ideas on how I was going to change my life. I wanted to go back to school but the only way that would have happened is by taking a student loan and I had no on-demand skills, so my choices were limited. After a couple of months of research I decided to live the comfort of my daily routine and took a second job to save money and decided I deserved a vacation, a long vacation.
                <br/><br/>
                So there I was, working 14 hours, 5 days a week and the other times I was not working I was researching how to stretch my budget. Where would I go first? Europe was my safe choice obviously but when you’re a migrant living in California, international travel is a bit different. I am a Salvadoran Native, I moved to California back in 2008 escaping the increasing violence against young males by the street gangs. Going back to El Salvador after 10 years was scary to think about but I am really happy I went, I got to see my family and friends and of course eating pupusas. This was the beginning of my trip! From my home in California, passing through to 20 countries, volunteering in family farms to finally settle down in beautiful Barcelona. You will read about all the maneuvering, immigration issues, and all the things I did trying to stretch my budget</p>
